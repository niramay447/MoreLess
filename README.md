# MoreLess 
 
The classic version of higher lower is you compare one search term, against another search term and you have to say if the second one has higher or lower searches And then now it gives you a new term to compare.And you keep going until you get it wrong. And it's a weirdly addictive game for some reason.
But in this version, Instead of comparing average monthly searches on Google, we're comparing who has more followers on Instagram.
The aim of the game is to try and stay alive for as long as possible and score as high as possible by thinking about who might be more popular than the other.
